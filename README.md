# Challenge for Software Engineer or Frontend Engineer

Submitted by Sunil Rawal

Completed in a little over 3 hours, with some light core-data code borrowed from my personal stash. 
Targets iOS 7 and is fine on iPhone 4 to 6+.
This code uses Google places for place lookup. The account is in my name but the API key is in the code. I'll turn it off after you've looked through the code.
I'm using a free icon pack in there for some design juice.
